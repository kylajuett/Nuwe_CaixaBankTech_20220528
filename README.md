# Nuwe_CaixaBankTech_20220528
Kyla Juett non-submission for the CaixaBank Tech / Nuwe hackathon

Summary:
  Unfortunately, I spent time building the wrong model & then didn't have enough time left in the day to learn & then build the correct one. So I'm not able to turn in a product that will earn me a high rank in the hackathon (or any rank, whoops).
  
  I'm super bummed to miss out on the chance to impress a great company that's doing some _awesome_ work in tech these days & that I would LOVE to work for.
  
  Thanks to Nuwe & CaixaBank Tech for the chance to do this fun activity & I hope to have the opportunity another day to show y'all how great I am so we can build cool things together!
